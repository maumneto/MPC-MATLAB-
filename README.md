# MPC in MATLAB
MPC MISO/SISO implementation in MATLAB

# Presentation
Hello everyone! 
This is a code made by @maumneto that implements a Model Predictive Control (MPC) in MATLAB script.
An important information about this code: you need have a MATLAB version with Model Predictive Control Toolbox to use it. If your version of MATLAB has the control toolbox, possibly will have the MPC toolbox as well.
Well, in this project, we implement a MPC-MISO (Multiple Inputs - Single Output) and MPC-SISO (Single Input - Single Output) using RUBiS distribution as input to the system. 

# An implementations list follows:
- RUBiS data base - rubisData.mat;
- Code to create transfer functions from database provided - CodeCreateTF.m;
- Code thats implements MPC SISO - SISOexample.m;
- MPC MISO codes - MpcMisoWithNoise-*.m;
