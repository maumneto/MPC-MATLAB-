# MPC-MATLAB-
MPC MISO/SISO implementation in MATLAB

# Code Presentation
Hello everyone! 
This is a code made by @maumneto thats implements a Model Predictive Control (MPC) in MATLAB script!
An important information about this code: you need have a MATLAB version with Model Predictive Control Toolbox to use it. If your version of MATLAB has the control toolbox, possibly will have the MPC toolbox as well.
Well, in this project, we implement a MPC-MISO (Multiple Inputs - Single Output) and SISO MPC (Single Input - Single Output) using RUBiS distribution as input to the system. 

# An implementations list follows:
- RUBiS database - rubisData.mat;
- Code to create trasfer functions from database provided - CodeCreateTF.m;
- Code thats implements MPC SISO - SISOexample.m;
- MPC MISO codes - MpcMisoWithNoise-*.m;
